Hello, Friends.

This is my very first attempt at HTML and CSS.

**I had fun!**

You are welcome to judge, but judge kindly. ^^

There are still a lot to improve on and learn about, but in this project I focused on getting acquainted with VS code, Git, and Github.

Thanks to The Odin Project for the introduction.

Moving forward, I hope to create more projects with different levels of complexity.

**Let's cheer each other on! :)))**
